# Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code: —

- Factory Method — A creational design pattern that provides an Interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- Abstract Factory Method — A creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- Builder — A creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- Singleton — A creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance.

- Prototype — A creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
